# Unibo
This project utilizes control theory in the design of lateral and longitudinal balancing systems for a one wheeled board.
The main controller was an Arduino Uno that took feedback from gyroscope and accelerometer sensors on the 2 main axis based on the tilt of the board. 
The Arduino then corrected the angles by outputting the right amount of power to the main DC motor for the longitudinal system and the right tilt on rotating gyros for the lateral system.
